The exact content of the review is still in development, but it should aim to include the following topics:

1. A review of interoperable sources of epidemiology data
1. Integration of the sources towards an interoperable data space
1. Multidimensional (convolution/dimension reduction, multivariate analysis) towards a "radar": the concept is an easy portal to explore live analysis on time series epidemiological data. Data will be brought in periodically from a source (or range of sources), be analysed, and then displayed in a human-interpretable format.

The current aim is for the review to be written according to the [Distill publication guidelines](https://distill.pub/journal/). 

--- 

The specification for the review is as follows (source: QUB):

> All postgraduate research students in the School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences are required to write a literature review (~3,000 words excluding references) relevant to their research project. <br/>
This will include comprehensive background discussion of the chosen research area, providing a clear rationale for the research question(s) which should be stated at the end of the literature review. Preparation of a detailed literature review will help students both to develop deep understanding of their research area and academic writing skills.<br/>
Specific content and structure should be discussed with individual supervisor(s) who will provide constructive critique on both scientific knowledge/understanding and writing and will also include a formal report in the differentiation form.
